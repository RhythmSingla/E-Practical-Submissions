E-Practical Submissions

Project E- Practical Submission reduces the writing work of practical files and focuses more on 
performing practicals. Students can work in a stress-free environment. And the teachers don’t have 
to maintain long records of various students.
This project aims to reduce large handwritten work in the "Lab Experiment Files", thus increasing 
the much-needed scope for practical knowledge.

E-Practical submission helps students pay more attention to practicals in their physical classes, thus 
reducing their burden of writing long files and physical submissions.
This also helps the teacher - the teacher doesn’t have to maintain long records of numerous classes 
with many students. He/she shall get all the information on the portal where and when they can 
check the files and mark it. 

So, there will be a thorough record of student's performance in a single place, which will remain for 
the whole semester without bearing any loss issues.
